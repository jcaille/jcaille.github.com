						<h3>RateMyClass</h3>
						<p><strong>Side Project ; 2012</strong> : RateMyClass is an internal school website a friend and I developed last year. It provides coherent information on classes at the Ecole Polytechnique based on a wide response from student opinion. The website is still in activity, and will be maintained and improved by the student government when we will leave campus. </p>

				<div class='span4'>
					<h3>CodeBar</h3>
					<p><strong>Side Project : 2012</strong> : CodeBar is a service that will allow users to place orders in busy bars using their phone. We’re a team of four people wanting to get a first hands-on experience with entrepreneurship. I started working on the web application a few months ago, and we’re currently looking for a bar willing to test our service and partner with us. </p>

					<h3>Team Research Project</h3>
					<p><strong>School Project ; 2011 - 2012</strong> : With a team of 6, we created a pragmatic device that would recognize the content of one’s tray in the school cafeteria. The Jury congratulated us on our results even though I would have liked to have more time to improve the algorithm and integrate our device with existing cash registers. </p>
				</div>
				<div class='span4'>
					<h3>Computer Graphics Project</h3>
					<p><strong> School Project ; 2012 </strong> With a friend, we implemented the algorithm described in Fast and Exact Computation of Geodesic Distance on Triangular Meshes. We also implemented subdivision schemes allowing for a finer representation of the distance field. The code is available on Github.</p>
				</div>
				<div class='span4'>
					<h3>Computer Vision Project</h3>
					<p><strong> School Project ; 2012 </strong> I worked on reconstructing stereographic 3D using GraphCut algorithms. Even though this project was pretty limited in scope, I see it as a stepping-stone into more interesting computer vision problems. </p>
